### Medical Language Model for Disease-Symptom Analysis  

#### Project Description:  
A transformer-based language model built using the GPT-2 architecture, fine-tuned on a dataset of diseases and their associated symptoms. The model learns to generate context-aware medical text by leveraging deep learning and advanced natural language processing techniques. It was developed using the Hugging Face Transformers library and PyTorch, providing accurate disease-symptom predictions and insights.  

#### Features:  
- **Custom Dataset Integration**: Utilizes a curated dataset of diseases and symptoms to fine-tune the GPT-2 transformer.  
- **Efficient Tokenization**: Employs the GPT-2 tokenizer to handle large text sequences with padding and truncation.  
- **Training and Validation**: Includes robust training and validation loops with real-time loss tracking for model evaluation.  
- **Text Generation**: Generates medically relevant text using advanced decoding strategies like top-k sampling and temperature control.  
- **Model Saving**: Trained model can be exported for deployment or further fine-tuning.  

#### Requirements:  
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 1.9+
- Transformers Library (Hugging Face)


#### Installation:  
1. Clone the repository.  
2. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.  
3. Run the training script to fine-tune the model or load the pre-trained weights for text generation.  

#### Usage:  
```bash
python train.py  # To train the model
python generate.py --input "Kidney Failure"  # For text generation
```
